# Sonic and the Fallen Star OST Port for Sonic 3 AIR
## What is this mod?

This is an audio script mod that attemps to port the OST from the fangame Sonic and The Fallen Star into the Sonic 3 Fan Remaster "Sonic 3 Angel Island Revisited".

## What does it contains?

• Both the official OST by Hollie (Including all the extras) and the alternate one by Hi. were ported. You can switch between them in the options of the mod just like the original fangame (Hollie's OST is the default). The list of the tracks replaced in the mod is [here](TRACKS-LIST.MD).
 
- Per-Zone Separate Act 2 Boss Music just like the original fangame (Flying Battery, Sandopolis and Sky Sanctuary remain unchanged).

- Custom Speed Shoes Music (All credits goes to LaveSlime for the original code from their "Dedicated Speed Shoes Music" mod, all I did was edit it to make it work with the options of this mod. Obviously i asked for permission before using it in the mod, even if it was free to use, proof [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hexfalc/SATFS-OST-PORT-S3AIR/main/images/Screenshot_2023-03-30-21-37-00-50_40deb401b9ffe8e1df2f1cc5ba480b12.jpg))
 

• Also, if you want a more SATFS-like experience, I added an option to force Infinite Lives and Swap the Super/Hyper Theme option to Level Music (This is enabled by default).


## Download

Grab a release from the [releases tab](https://github.com/Hexfalc/SATFS-OST-PORT-S3AIR/releases) or download (or clone) the repo if you want a more unstable version with the latest changes (i don't recommend it if you want to simply play the mod)
