# Sonic and the Fallen Star OST Port for Sonic 3 AIR
## What is this mod?
This is an audio script mod that tries to port the ost from the fangame Sonic and The Fallen Star into the sonic 3 fan remaster Sonic 3 AIR

## What does it contains?

•This mod contains both the official ost by Hollie (Including all the extras) and the alternate one by Hi.. You can switch between the two in the options of the mod just like the original fangame (The default one is the one by Hollie).

•An option to force infinite lives and swap the super theme to the level music (Activated by default).

•Per-Zone Act 2 boss music just like the original (fbz, sandopolis and ssz remain unchanged).

•Custom Speed Shoes music (Credits to LaveSlime for this, the code was taken from their Dedicated Speed Shoes Music mod with permission, i just edited it to use the option from this mod).
